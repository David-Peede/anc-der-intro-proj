# The Utility of Ancestral and Derived Allele Sharing for Genome-Wide Inferences of Introgression

This GitHub repository contains all the coded necessary to reproduce all the results, figures, and tables from Peede et al. 202X. Note that all analyses directories contain a `README.md` with walkthroughs of how to generate all the necessary simulated/empirical data along with annotated Juypter notebook(s) for reproducing all analyses, figures, and tables. For your convenience I will hyperlink all walkthroughs and analyses below and if you have any questions feel free to contact me at `david_peede[at]brown.edu`.
